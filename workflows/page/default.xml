      <h3 style="text-align:center">How to use EASY PAGES</h3>

      <p>You may wish to create a new page for many reasons; announcements, documentation, instructions, further details, etc.</p>
      <p>With the easy pages tool you can easily create a page to provide information.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Provide a title for the page, this will appear at the top of the page as a heading.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Provide a language for the page, if this EPrints instance is multi-lingual.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Add the page contents and use the document formatting tool to organise the information appropriately.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> Lastly, enter a path name. This will be the reposities URL with /page/the-name-you-choose appeneded.</p>
      <h4>Multiple Langauges</h4>
      <p>Multiple languages can be supported by adding multiple pages with the same path, and different language. The best available path for the current language will be displayed to the user.</p>
      
      <p>For example, for a multi-lingual information page, create two pages with the same path ("information" for the default information page) each in a different langauge (for example, English and German). When a user has configured EPrints to be in English the information page in English will be presented at /page/information. When Eprints is configured in German, the german information page will be presented at /page/information. Any extra pages with the same path in the same langauge will be ignored.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Once you have finished you can click Save and Return, this will provide you with a link to the finished page.</p>
      <p>Use the link just as you would use a normal URL link. For example, it could be added to the repository home page, added to a workflow field description, sent out in an email etc.</p>
      <p><b>Pages can be managed via <a href="/cgi/users/home?screen=Listing&amp;dataset=page">'Manage records > Pages'</a>.  This is limited to Admin users only.</b></p>
      <p><b>All created pages are public.  A list of pages can be accessed via <a href="{$config{https_root}}/pages.html">REPO-URL/pages.html</a></b></p>
